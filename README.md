# Sloan-Digital-Sky-Survey
Classification model for stellar objects based on SDSS data. This repo contains a jupyter notebook that uses a small subset of data collected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to classify observations as one of three types: galaxy, QSO, or stars.  This is done using the XGBoostClassifier.
